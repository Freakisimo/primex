# Primex
This is an educational exercise with the following objectives:
* Refactor and document someone else's code
* Provide a usable primes generator, like ruby's Prime module

Original code comes from http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#Elixir

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `primex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:primex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/primex](https://hexdocs.pm/primex).
